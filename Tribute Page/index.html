            <p>
                Born 1877 in Kerry, Ireland. Joined the Royal Navy at 15 years of age. Served on “Discovery” from 1901 – 1904 and “Terra
                Nova” 1910 – 1913 under Captain Robert Scott and from 1914 – 1916 served on “Endurance” under Sir Ernest
                Shackleton.

                Survived for months trapped on the ice floes after the ship was crushed and journeyed with Shackleton and four others in
                a 21-foot lifeboat, across the South Atlantic (800 miles). They scaled the uncharted glaciers of South Georgia
                to reach help for their stricken colleagues left behind. Received the “Albert Medal” for bravery.

                Returned to UK in 1916 to serve out the remaining time of WW1 and was medically discharged in 1919. He married a local Irish
                girl from Annascaul called Nell, and returned home to Ireland. They brought up two daughters Mary and Eileen.
                Sadly their middle daughter Kate died aged 4 in 1924. He remained in Annascaul, where he ran a public house
                with Nelle, until his death in 1938 of a burst appendix, aged 61.
